THINGS TODO:
Listed down some of the items that i planned to do in this project but restricted due to time or scope of this project

*	Dependency injection through pico-containers as this will help in instantiating object of other page object classes or utilities. 
	Driver can also be shared with multiple step definition files. This is a must to do in a bigger project.
*	A better logging 
*	A better tear down for bigger projects is a must including taking screen shots and attaching application logs if possible.

Good to haves:
*	Documentation for test methods describing method actions, input parameters and return values.
*	Integrate a custom reports 
*	Create Scenario context to share context between steps or any action to be performed at framework level
*	Better exception handling -more specfic exceptions and sending them to logs
*	Still step definition methods can be a little more modularized
